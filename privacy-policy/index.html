                        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
    Sage Bionetworks (“Sage Bionetworks, “we,” or “us”) is a 501(c)(3)
    nonprofit biomedical research organization in the United States.
</p>
<p>
    Sage Bionetworks is running the Journey PRO research study. In the Journey
    PRO research study, we are looking at how chronic anemia impacts quality of
    life. If you join this study we will ask you to download and use the
    Journey PRO app. You can learn more about the study on the Journey PRO
    website.
</p>
<p>
    Sage Bionetworks is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of the
    Journey PRO app and website. This privacy policy tells what we will do with
    the information we collect from you through the app and website.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        By visiting the Journey PRO website, joining the study, or using the
        Journey PRO app, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
    </strong>
</p>
<h2>
    Information We Collect
</h2>
<p>
    In general, we collect all the information that you give us directly. We
    also collect information passively when you visit the Journey PRO website
    or use the Journey PRO app.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u>Standard log files and usage data.</u>
        When you visit the Journey PRO website, we collect standard server log
        information, like your internet protocol address or your browser type.
        We also collect information about how you use the app and website. For
        example, the pages you access or the date and time you sign in. We do
        not collect information using cookies, beacons, or device
        fingerprinting.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Before you can join Journey PRO, you must download the app on your
    smartphone and register for the study. We will collect information from you
    through the Journey PRO app as part of the registration process and when
    you use the app for the study. Here is a list of what we will collect and
    when we will collect it:
</p>
<p>
    As part of the registration you must complete the informed consent process
    and create an account.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u>Informed consent:</u>
        The informed consent process explains the research study. You must
        consent in order to join the study. We will collect your first and last
        name and your signature as part of the informed consent process.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Account creation:</u>
        <strong> </strong>
        You must create your personal study account.<strong> </strong>When you
        create an account, we will collect a username, password, and your email
        address. We ask your year of birth. The Journey PRO study is designed
        for people age 18 or older. We do not knowingly allow children under
        the age of 18 to join the Journey PRO study.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once you join the study we will collect information about your heath and
    wellness through surveys and activities.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u>Health surveys.</u>
        <strong> </strong>
        As part of the Journey PRO research study, we collect information about
        you. We will ask you about your health and medical history. Most of
        these questions are optional. We will ask a few required questions. For
        example, “Do you have chronic anemia?” These questions are required
        because we need to know the answers as part of the research study.
    </li>
    <li>
        <u>Information imports.</u>
        As part of the research study we will import information into the
        Journey PRO app. For example, we will ask you to do a short walking
        activity. We will import information from the sensors in your
        smartphone about how far you walk and how long you walk for into the
        Journey PRO app.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We will ask you to link the Journey PRO app to HealthKit, the Apple health
    app. In this way, we may import information from HealthKit like your
    weight, height, the number of steps you take and/or your sleep patterns.
    Any information that we import from HealthKit will be treated the same as
    the information we collect in the Journey PRO app directly.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to note that we do not have control over the privacy
    policies or practices of HealthKit. You can participate in the Journey PRO
    research study even if you do not want to link information from HealthKit
    to the Journey PRO app.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u>Location data. </u>
        We will ask you to link the Journey PRO app to your smartphone’s GPS
        (global positioning system). We will use your GPS to tell us how far
        you travel when you use the app. This will help us understand how
        active you are. We do not collect your actual location, just the
        distance you travel.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We will NOT access your personal contacts, photos, text, or email messages
    on your smartphone. We will only collect information that you give to
    Journey PRO.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<h2>
    How We Use Information
</h2>
<p>
    In addition to using it for scientific research, we will use the
    information that we collect through the Journey PRO app and website to
    ensure that they are working properly.
</p>
<p>
    Also, we will use the information we collect to improve the app and to make
    it easier to use. For example, remembering information you have entered so
    it does not need to be re-entered.
</p>
<p>
    We may use personal information, like your name and email address, to
    contact you. Some examples of why we might contact you are for
    administrative purposes or to tell you more about the Journey PRO study.
</p>
<p>
    We will NOT use your personal information for advertising.
</p>

<h2>How We Process Information</h2>

<p>
    We process the information we collect through the Journey PRO app. Here are
    the steps we will take to process your information:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    We will separate your account information like your name and email
    address from your study data like your answers to the surveys.
</li>
<li>
    We will assign you a random study code. We will add this code to your
    study data. The key that links this code to your name is kept in a
    separate, secure location.
</li>
<li>
    We will combine your coded study data (without your name) with the coded
    study data from other people in the Journey PRO research study. We will use
    this combined data for our research.
</li>
</ol>
    <h2>Why We Disclose Information</h2>

<p>
    We will disclose (give out) information that we collect through the Journey
    PRO app for five reasons. We tell you about these reasons below. Other than
    the reasons below, we will not sell, rent, lease, give away, disclose or
    share your personal information without your permission.
</p>
<p>
    Five reasons we disclose information:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
    We will store the Journey PRO research data we collect on Synapse.
    Synapse is a cloud-based research platform. Researchers from the study team
    and research partners will access and analyze the data. We will report the
    results of our research through blogs or scientific publications. Your name
    will not appear.
</li>
<li>
    If we work with a service provider, we will give them the information
    they need to do the job we have asked them to do. A service provider is
    someone who is helping us with a part of the Journey PRO research study.
    The service provider will have to sign a contract promising to use the
    information only for the job they are doing for us. Also, they will promise
    to keep the information we share with them secure.
</li>
<li>
    We may give out information if we are required to do so by law. For
    example, to comply with state or federal laws, in response to a court
    order, subpoena or warrant, or to cooperate with law enforcement or other
    governmental agencies.
</li>
<li>
    We may give out information:

<ul>
<li>
    To protect ourselves against liability
</li>
<li>
    To protect ourselves from fraud, abuse, or unlawful activity
</li>
<li>
    To investigate and defend ourselves against claims or allegations
</li>
<li>
    To protect the Journey PRO app and research study
</li>
<li>
    To protect our rights
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
    The information we collect from you as part of the Journey PRO study may
    be considered a business asset. Business assets are the things that give a
    business value. If we go bankrupt or if Sage Bionetworks merges, is
    transferred, or acquired by another institution, the information we have
    may be transferred to them as a business asset.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Do Not Track</h2>
<p>
    We do not track people who use the Journey PRO app or visit the study
    website. Because we do not track people, the Journey PRO app and website do
    not respond specifically to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Sage Bionetworks takes data security very seriously. We use systems and
    procedures to protect the information we collect from you. This is to
    safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and security of your information.
    These systems and procedures help us prevent accidental or unlawful loss,
    theft, and misuse. They help us prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
    alteration, destruction, or any other type of unlawful processing. For
    instance, we separate the information that identifies you, like your name,
    from your other study data. We keep the information that identifies you in
    a separate, secure place. Still, experts in re-identification may be able
    to reverse our processes and figure out who you are. We cannot promise that
    the information we collect from you is completely secure or that you will
    remain anonymous.
</p>
<h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>
    You have rights and choices about the information we collect from you. For
    example, if there is an error in the information we collect from you, you
    have the right to make a request to have it fixed.
</p>
<p>
    To make a request about the information we collect from you, email us at
    JourneyPRO@sagebase.org. Please note that we may keep a copy of all the
    information we collect from you. This is because we have a responsibility
    to keep backups and archives. We keep backups and archives for reasons like
    the prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, and for satisfaction of legal
    obligations.
</p>
<p>
    You can withdraw from (quit) the study at any time. If you would like to
    withdraw, click the “Leave study” link on your profile page in the Journey
    PRO app. Or you can email us at JourneyPRO@sagebase.org to withdraw. It
    does not cost anything to withdraw. If you withdraw, we will stop
    collecting information from you. We will not use your information for any
    new research.
</p>
<p>
    If you have questions about your rights and choices or would like more
    information about your rights and choices, you can email us at
    privacypolicy@sagebase.org.
</p>
<h2>Cross-Border Transfer of Your Information</h2>
<p>
    We may transfer the information you share with us to countries where you do
    not live. These countries may have different data protection laws than
    where you live. If we transfer your information, we will follow the laws
    about transferring data.
</p>
<p>
    If you access the Journey PRO app or participate in the study from anywhere
    outside of the United States, we may transfer your data. The information we
    collect may be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States.
</p>
<p>
    By using the Journey PRO app or participating in the study, you consent to
    these types of cross border transfers of your information.
</p>
<h2>Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy. We will post any updates here, on this
    page with a revision date. Also, if we make major changes that alter your
    rights or obligations, we will try to tell you directly. For example, we
    may send you an email or put a pop-up message in the app. If you
    participate in the study or use the Journey PRO app after we update the
    Privacy Policy it means you agree to the updated Privacy Policy.
