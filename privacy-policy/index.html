        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage Bionetworks (“Sage Bionetworks, “we,” or “us”) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit biomedical research organization in the United States.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage Bionetworks is running the Journey PRO research study. In the Journey PRO research study, we are looking at how chronic anemia impacts quality of life. If you join this study we will ask you to download and use the Journey PRO app. You can learn more about the study on the Journey PRO website.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage Bionetworks is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of the Journey PRO app and website. This privacy policy tells what we will do with the information we collect from you through the app and website.</span>
        </p>
        <p><b>By visiting the Journey PRO website, joining the study, or using the Journey PRO app, you agree to this
            Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</b></p>
        <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information We Collect</b></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, we collect all the information that you give us directly. We also collect information passively when you visit the Journey PRO website or use the Journey PRO app.</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard log files and usage data.</span><span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;When you visit the Journey PRO website, we collect standard server log information, like your internet protocol address or your browser type. We also collect information about how you use the app and website. For example, the pages you access or the date and time you sign in. We do not collect information using cookies, beacons, or device fingerprinting.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you can join Journey PRO, you must download the app on your smartphone and register for the study. We will collect information from you through the Journey PRO app as part of the registration process and when you use the app for the study. Here is a list of what we will collect and when we will collect it:</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the registration you must complete the informed consent process and create an account. &nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Informed consent:</span><span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The informed consent process explains the research study. You must consent in order to join the study. We will collect your first and last name and your signature as part of the informed consent process.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account creation:</span>&nbsp;<span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">You must create your personal study account.</span>&nbsp;<span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">When you create an account, we will collect a username, password, and your email address. We ask your year of birth. The Journey PRO study is designed for people age 18 or older. We do not knowingly allow children under the age of 18 to join the Journey PRO study. &nbsp;</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you join the study we will collect information about your heath and wellness through surveys and activities.</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health surveys.</span>&nbsp;<span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the Journey PRO research study, we collect information about you. We will ask you about your health and medical history. Most of these questions are optional. We will ask a few required questions. For example, “Do you have chronic anemia?” These questions are required because we need to know the answers as part of the research study.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information imports.</span><span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;As part of the research study we will import information into the Journey PRO app. For example, we will ask you to do a short walking activity. We will import information from the sensors in your smartphone about how far you walk and how long you walk for into the Journey PRO app.&nbsp;</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will ask you to link the Journey PRO app to HealthKit, the Apple health app. In this way, we may import information from HealthKit like your weight, height, the number of steps you take and/or your sleep patterns. Any information that we import from HealthKit will be treated the same as the information we collect in the Journey PRO app directly.&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that we do not have control over the privacy policies or practices of HealthKit. You can participate in the Journey PRO research study even if you do not want to link information from HealthKit to the Journey PRO app.</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location data.&nbsp;</span><span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">We will ask you to link the Journey PRO app to your smartphone’s GPS (global positioning system). We will use your GPS to tell us how far you travel when you use the app. This will help us understand how active you are. We do not collect your actual location, just the distance you travel.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will NOT access your personal contacts, photos, text, or email messages on your smartphone. We will only collect information that you give to Journey PRO.</span>
        </p>
        <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How We Use Information</b></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to using it for scientific research, we will use the information that we collect through the Journey PRO app and website to ensure that they are working properly.&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, we will use the information we collect to improve the app and to make it easier to use. For example, remembering information you have entered so it does not need to be re-entered.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use personal information, like your name and email address, to contact you. Some examples of why we might contact you are for administrative purposes or to tell you more about the Journey PRO study.&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will NOT use your personal information for advertising.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How We Process Information</b></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We process the information we collect through the Journey PRO app. Here are the steps we will take to process your information:</span>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will separate your account information like your name and email address from your study data like your answers to the surveys.&nbsp;</span>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will assign you a random study code. We will add this code to your study data. The key that links this code to your name is kept in a separate, secure location.&nbsp;</span>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will combine your coded study data (without your name) with the coded study data from other people in the Journey PRO research study. We will use this combined data for our research.&nbsp;</span>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why We Disclose Information</b></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will disclose (give out) information that we collect through the Journey PRO app for five reasons. We tell you about these reasons below. Other than the reasons below, we will not sell, rent, lease, give away, disclose or share your personal information without your permission.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five reasons we disclose information:</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will store the Journey PRO research data we collect on Synapse. Synapse is a cloud-based research platform. Researchers from the study team and research partners will access and analyze the data. We will report the results of our research through blogs or scientific publications. Your name will not appear.</span>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we work with a service provider, we will give them the information they need to do the job we have asked them to do. A service provider is someone who is helping us with a part of the Journey PRO research study. The service provider will have to sign a contract promising to use the information only for the job they are doing for us. Also, they will promise to keep the information we share with them secure.</span>
            </li>
        </ol>

            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may give out information if we are required to do so by law.

            </li>
        </ol>

                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To protect ourselves from fraud, abuse, or unlawful activity</span>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do Not Track</b></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not track people who use the Journey PRO app or visit the study website. Because we do not track people, the Journey PRO app and website do not respond specifically to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.</span>

        <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Security</b></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage Bionetworks takes data security very seriously. We use systems and procedures to protect the information we collect from you. This is to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and security of your information. These systems and procedures help us prevent accidental or unlawful loss, theft, and misuse. They help us prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, or any other type of unlawful processing. For instance, we separate the information that identifies you, like your name, from your other study data. We keep the information that identifies you in a separate, secure place. Still, experts in re-identification may be able to reverse our processes and figure out who you are. We cannot promise that the information we collect from you is completely secure or that you will remain anonymous.</span>
