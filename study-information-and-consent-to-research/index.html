        <p>This consent form tells about the Journey PRO research study. It explains what we will ask you to do to
            participate in the study. Please read this form carefully. If you have questions, there is a list of people
            you can contact at the end of this form. If you decide to join the study, we will email you a copy of this
            form to for you to keep.</p>

                <p><strong>What is Journey PRO?</strong></p>
                <p>Journey PRO is a research study. This study will look at how chronic anemia (low red blood cell
                    counts that persist over time) impacts health-related quality of life. You must be age 18 or older
                    and have an iPhone model 5 or newer with iOS 8 or later to join. We encourage people with chronic
                    anemia as a result of beta thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or myelofibrosis and people
                    who do not have chronic anemia to join Journey PRO.</p>
                <p>We will study quality of life by measuring health and overall well-being. If you join, we will ask
                    you to download the experimental Journey PRO app, where we will ask you to answer questions about
                    your quality of life. We will give some participants an Apple Watch. The Apple Watch will measure
                    your daily activity (for example, number of steps taken in a day, number of stairs climbed, etc.)
                    and your heart rate, which are signs of your health and well-being. We will look for patterns in the
                    data. In this way, we hope to learn more about how chronic anemia impacts quality of life for
                    people.</p>
                <p>Please note: Journey PRO is not a medical treatment. It is a research study. If you have questions
                    about your health, please see your doctor.</p>
                <p>We would like at least 300 people to join Journey PRO.</p>

                            <p>We will ask you to do about 5 minutes of daily study activities. Once a week, we will
                                also ask you to do a set of study activities that should take about 40 minutes. If you
                                decide to join the Journey PRO study, you can withdraw (quit) at any time.</p>

                                    as you like, even after the study is finished. However, we will collect your data
                                    only for as long as the study lasts.

                                <li>Answer a health survey. After you download the app, you will be asked to answer some
                                    questions about your health. This should take about 20 minutes. You will only be
                                    asked to do this one time.

                                <li>Do check-ins. Check-ins are a set of 3-9 questions. These questions should take
                                    about 5 minutes to complete. You can choose to complete a check-in once a day, once
                                    every two days, or twice a week. You can skip or postpone any question you do not
                                    want to answer.

                                    can skip or postpone any question or activity you do not want to answer/do.

                                        <li>Health survey. The health survey has about 30 questions. It will take about
                                            25 minutes to complete.

                                        <li>Brain tests. The brain tests measure your short-term memory, reaction time,
                                            and attention. Each of them takes about 3 minutes to complete.

                                        <li>Walking activity. We will ask you to walk as far as you can in 6 minutes.
                                            This measures fitness. It is not necessary to run or exercise heavily to

                                        <li>Heart rate. We will ask you to measure the number of times your heart beats
                                            in a minute using your iPhone or Apple Watch. We will provide instructions
                                            on how to do this.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Record health events. We will ask you to enter when you have blood taken and
                                            to record results related to your anemia, like hemoglobin levels. We will
                                            ask you to tell us if and when you have a transfusion and information about
                                            it, like the number of units of blood you receive. You can enter your
                                            doctor’s appointments and prescription drug changes. There is also a journal
                                            page where you can put notes. These notes are for you only. We will not
                                            collect them or look at them. Your notes are not part of the study.

                                <li>Wear a fitness tracker (optional) . If you have an Apple Watch fitness tracker, we
                                    will ask you to connect it to the Journey PRO app. In this way, we will know more
                                    about your activity level.
                                    <br> If you do not have an Apple Watch fitness tracker, we may ask if you would be
                                    willing to wear one for this study. This is optional. You can say no and still
                                    participate in Journey PRO. If you say yes, we may send you an Apple Watch. To
                                    activate it, you will need to create an Apple Watch account and link your Watch to
                                    your iPhone. We will ask that you wear the Apple Watch every day you participate in
                                    the study. It will record information like the number of steps you take and your
                                    heart rate.
                                </li>

                    <p class="p1"><strong>What are the risks of taking part in Journey PRO?</strong></p>
                    <p class="p1">The main risk of taking part in the Journey PRO research study is to your privacy. If
                        there is a data breach, someone could get access to the information we have about you. Your
                        information could be misused. We believe the chance of this is very small, but it is not
                        zero.</p>
                    <p class="p1">We will gather information from you through the Journey PRO app. We may also gather
                        information from you through an Apple Watch. There is a risk to your privacy whenever you use an
                        app or fitness tracker like an Apple Watch. In general, there is no additional risk to your
                        privacy if you use these technologies as part of the Journey PRO research study . However, we
                        will be collecting several different types of information from you, so if there is a data
                        breach, there may be additional risk to your privacy because of the amount of information the
                        study database contains about you.</p>
                    <p class="p1">If we give you an Apple Watch to use, you will be asked to agree to the Apple Watch
                        Terms of Service and Privacy Policy . Please review both of these policies carefully. We do not
                        have control over these policies; they are set and updated by Apple.</p>

                        <li class="p1">Data collected in this study could count against your phone’s data plan. You can
                            configure the app to use only wifi to limit the impact data collection has on your data

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Are there any benefits to joining?</strong></p>
                    <p class="p1">Journey PRO is not a medical treatment. It is a research study. You will not get
                        direct medical benefit from taking part in it. You will be helping scientists make discoveries
                        that may help others in the future with similar diseases.</p>
                    <p class="p1">You may indirectly benefit from taking part. For example, you will be able to see all
                        of your study data. This information may be interesting to you. You may learn about your health
                        and well-being. If you choose, you can share your Journey PRO information with your health care
                        team.</p>
                    <p class="p1">We may give you an Apple Watch to use in the study. You can keep it after the study
                        ends and use it for as long as you like.</p>
                    <p class="p1"><strong>What are my options if I do not take part?</strong></p>
                    <p class="p1">This is not a treatment study, your alternative is not to take part.</p>
                    <p class="p1"><strong>Are there any costs or payments?</strong></p>
                    <p class="p1">There are no direct costs to you or your insurance. There may be an indirect cost to
                        participating: the data we collect from you through the app may count against your phone’s data
                        plan.</p>
                    <p class="p1">There are no direct payments. We may give you an Apple Watch to use as part of the
                        study. If we give you one, you can keep it.</p>
                    <p class="p1">Your information will be used by scientists to make discoveries. If any of their
                        research leads to new tests, drugs, or other commercial products, you will not get any profits.
                        These inventions will be the property of the scientists who develop them.</p>
                    <p class="p1"><strong>Will you ever give out my name or other information that identifies
                        me?</strong></p>
                    <p class="p1">We will never sell, rent, or lease your contact information.</p>
                    <p class="p1">However, we will give out information as required by law or regulation. For example,
                        there are regulations that make sure scientific research is safe and ethical. These regulations
                        specify that officials from the U.S. government, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
                        (FDA), must be able to review our work.</p>

                    <p class="p1">If you get an Apple Watch and wear it as part of this study, Apple will have
